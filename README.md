# Ersatz Keyboard

Ersatz Keyboard provides a framework that can be used to create custom keyboard extensions that resemble the built-in iOS keyboards.

It is based on Archagon's [Tasty Imitation Keyboard](https://github.com/archagon/tasty-imitation-keyboard/), with changes from [Kevin Lohman's fork](https://github.com/UnifyBadPirate/tasty-imitation-keyboard).

This project is currently in development for use in another project.

## Features of the original

* Rendered entirely using CoreGraphics.
* Dynamic Layouts â€“ All the keys are laid out programmatically, meaning that the keyboard is much easier to extend and will automatically work on devices of all sizes.
* Support for auto-capitalization, period shortcut, keyboard clicks.
* An extensible settings screen.
* Dark mode and solid color mode.
